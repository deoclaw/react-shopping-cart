# Shopping Cart React

## Requirements

1. Setup and Basic Components

   ~~Initialize a new ReactJS application using Create React App.~~ Used Vite as create react app is depreciated

   ::white_check_mark:: Create a Product component to display product information: name, image, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.

   :white_check_mark: Implement a Products component to list available products, utilizing the Product component for each item.

2. Advanced Components and State Management

   Develop a Cart component to show items the user intends to purchase, including product name, image, price, quantity, and a "Remove from Cart" button.
   Use React state to manage the items in the cart, implementing functionality to add and remove products.

3. Navigation and Routing

   Integrate react-router-dom for navigation, setting up routes for your Home, Product Detail, Search, and Cart pages.
   Ensure smooth navigation within your application without page reloads.

4. Context for State Management

   Implement React Context to manage and share state across components, such as the shopping cart's content, avoiding prop drilling for deeply nested components.

5. Checkout and Form Handling

   Create a Checkout component with a form for shipping information and order review, displaying cart items and the total price.
   Handle form submissions, clearing the cart upon a successful submission and redirecting the user to a "Thank You" page.

6. Styling and User Interface

   Use CSS to style your components, focusing on creating a visually appealing and intuitive interface.
